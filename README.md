# Healthcare-Performance-Dashboard-Analysis

This project analyzes healthcare performance metrics using a dashboard visualization. The data includes key indicators related to hospital occupancy, staff responsiveness, and patient safety. The project aims to provide meaningful insights into hospital operations, focusing on patient experience and efficiency. The visualizations are built using Power BI to track trends over time and improve decision-making in healthcare management.

Key Insights & KPIs
Licensed Bed Occupancy Rate

Total Average: 57.73%

Yearly Contribution: Each year contributes approximately 19-20% to the total occupancy.

Unassisted Fall Rate per 1,000 Patient Days

Average: 2.61 falls per 1,000 patient days.

This metric helps in monitoring patient safety and implementing preventive measures.

Staff Responsiveness Domain Top Box Score

Average Score: 63

Benchmark Comparison: The responsiveness score is tracked against benchmarks to ensure quality care.

Trend Analysis: Over the years, the responsiveness score shows fluctuations, indicating areas for improvement.

Correlation Between Licensed Bed Occupancy and Other Factors

Higher occupancy rates tend to impact staff responsiveness negatively.

Unassisted fall rates increase with higher occupancy rates, suggesting a possible strain on staff.

Monthly Trends and Seasonal Variations

Heatmap analysis shows variations across months, helping identify seasonal trends in hospital performance.

Technology & Tools Used
Power BI for data visualization

Excel for data aggregation and transformation

This project serves as a valuable tool for hospital management to optimize staff responsiveness, reduce fall rates, and maintain optimal bed occupancy levels.
